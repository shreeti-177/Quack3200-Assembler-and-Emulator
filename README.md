# Assembly Language Instructions
DC - define constant. The constant is a decimal integer placed in the operand field.
DS - define storage. The operand specifies the number of words of storage to be set aside.
ORG -define origin. The operand specifies the address at which the translation of the next instruction will be generated,
END â€“ indicates that there are no additional statements to translate.
